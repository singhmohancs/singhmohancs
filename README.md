## Professional Summary

Hi, I'm a senior full-stack architect with 14+ years helping startups grow into successful companies. I specialize in building complete end-to-end solutions - from backend architecture to frontend user experience, including mobile apps and deployment.

**What I do best:**
- Complete full-stack architecture: React, Angular, Node.js, Python, Laravel
- Frontend excellence: React, Angular, React Native (mobile apps)
- Backend systems: Node.js, Python Flask, Laravel APIs
- Database design: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB

**Why frontend architecture matters for your business:**
The frontend is what your customers actually use to interact with your backend systems. A strong, user-friendly, maintainable, and responsive frontend application directly adds value to your business by improving user experience, increasing conversions, and reducing support costs.

**My approach:**
I architect complete solutions that work seamlessly together. While I excel at creating beautiful, fast frontends, I ensure the entire system - backend APIs, databases, mobile apps, and deployment - works perfectly as one unified solution.
